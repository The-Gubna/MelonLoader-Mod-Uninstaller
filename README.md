# MelonLoader-Mod-Uninstaller
This will delete all Phasmophobia MelonLoader and mod related files.

Instructions:
Each MelonLoader Uninstaller has a letter after the file name. That letter corresponds
	to where ever you save your Steam games, that will be the drive letter to use.
Typically that is the "C:\" or "D:\" drive.
Just match up the drive letter with the letter in the MelonLoader Uninstaller file name.

Additional Instructions:
When running the Uninstaller, you may get several prompts to type y/n
Make sure to type y and press enter for each prompt.
Once the window with the prompts closes, the Uninstaller is finished.

Verifying Local Files:
After running the Uninstaller, go to Steam. Right-click Phasmophobia, select Properties.
Go to "Local Files" and click "verify integrity  of game files".
Once that runs, the game is ready to be played again.
